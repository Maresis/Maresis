My name is Morgan Hunt and I'm majoring in the Bacholors of Science Computer Science Program. 

Below are projects I plan to work on this semester: 
1. A medium complexity calculator. It should be able to perform all basic operations, and follow the appropriate order of operations. 
2. I also want to make a simple base-n converter to practice some things with recursion.
